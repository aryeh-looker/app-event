### Using as an App

To use as an app, you first need to add an event adapter in a project named `aea_event_adapter` as specified in the manifest.lkml.

By default `aea_event_adapter` can be connected to the [GA360](https://github.com/looker/aea_ga360_adapter/blob/master/ga_customize.view.lkml).

The Event Adapter is assumed to pass the a sessions view and explore.
